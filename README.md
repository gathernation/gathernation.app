## GatherNation

Welcome to Gathernation! This app makes it easy to gather with friends!

### App Mission

We need technology to serve non-technology interactions! It's time to move past digital gatherings and meet with friends. This streamlined app makes gatherings easy to coordinate. When you are invited, it's easy to opt out and easy to stay in the loop. Time for technology to facilitate real life! 

### App Support

The Settings area of the app allows you to revisit the Welcome Slides to refresh yourself on the basics of the app. Under the Setup dropdown in Settings, you may Log Out if you want to sign in with a different phone number. 

If anyone is harrassing you, you can navigate to the Friends screen, find that "friend," and Block them. If you want to unblock them, you can do that under Settings.

1. We send phone numbers to a third party vendor to text you the login code.
2. We pass your notification token to a third party vendor to send you app notifications.
